# Roll Dice

Simple dice roller in node.js.

# How to use

On the project folder, run the command:
```console
node roll-dice <optional num-of-dice>
```

The third argument, indicating the number of dice in a  roll, is completely optional. The default value is set to two.

It was a quick program so there was no testing done. Moreover, there were no assertions made on the inputs of the program... sorry.
